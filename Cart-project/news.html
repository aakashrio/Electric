            <h1>Capcom Reveals When Fans Can Expect More Monster Hunter Wilds News</h1>
            <h5>Longtime Monster Hunter series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto reveals that the next announcement for Monster Hunter Wilds will drop soon.</h5>
            <p>Fans of the popular Japanese action RPG series Monster Hunter can expect to hear more news about the franchise's next mainline game, Monster Hunter Wilds, later in 2024, according to developer and publisher Capcom. The announcement comes as the series prepares to celebrate its 20th anniversary this year.
                Capcom released Monster Hunter's eponymous debut title for the PlayStation 2 all the way back in March 2004. Since then, the series has only grown, peaking with the massively successful Monster Hunter: World from 2018 that has sold an estimated 19 million units worldwide. The franchise's next major installment is Monster Hunter Wilds, and fans will supposedly be able to learn more about the upcoming title soon.</p>

            <h1>Tekken 8 New Fighter Seemingly Leaked On Official YouTube Channel</h1>
            <h5>A private video on the official Bandai Namco YouTube channel suggests that we're getting another character reveal very soon.</h5>
            <p>Bandai Namco may have just accidentally revealed a new DLC fighter coming to Tekken 8. According to fans, the official YouTube channel briefly made an unreleased trailer public. Going on the playlist now, we can see that there's a private video uploaded to the channel, so this mysterious reveal could come very soon.

                As spotted by ResetEra user Musubi, a screenshot circulating online says that the trailer will reveal Josie is joining the roster as DLC. If accurate, this means she's returning from her debut game, Tekken 7, albeit not on the main roster. It's not clear when Bandai Namco plans to officially unveil this new character, whoever they end up being.</p>

            <h1>Nvidia RTX 40 Super GPUs Announced: Price, Release Date, And More</h1>
            <h5>Nvidia's next graphics cards have been announced and are coming soon.</h5>
            <p>At the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia announced its next wave of GPUs. The RTX 40 Super Series, as it's called, is releasing later this month. The new cards include the GeFore RTX 4080 Super, the GeForce RTX 4070 Ti Super, and the GeForce RTX 4070 Super; the cheapest card starts at $600.
                The cards support Nvidia's AI-powered Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS), as well as other features like frame generation and ray reconstruction, along with ray tracing. According to Nvidia, the new cards offer up to four times better image quality, even when seven out of eight pixels are generated by AI.</p>

                </div>

            <p>The RTX 4080 Super releases January 31 for $1000, with the RTX 4070 Ti Super debuting January 24 for $800. The RTX 4070 Super, meanwhile, releases January 17 for $600. The cards will be available from Nvidia directly and through the normal retailers.


                Also during the Consumer Electronics Show, Nvidia announced the newest updates for its Avatar Cloud Engine (ACE) that companies like Ubisoft, Tencent, and NetEase are currently using. Nvidia partnered with the company Convai to create a "Kairos" demo that shows how developers can use AI let non-playable characters have unique background conversations. The tools also allow human players to speak directly to NPCs and have a conversation. As you can see in the video demonstration above, it's still early days and has more refinement to go.</p>

            <h5>Rockstar Games releases highly anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 trailer, confirming leaks and announcing release for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in 2025.</h5>
            <p>Rockstar Games finally released the trailer for its long-awaited Grand Theft Auto 6 on Tuesday, hours ahead of schedule thanks to a supposed trailer leak on social media platform X (formerly Twitter).

            The GTA 6 trailer confirms many of the leaks that have been circulating around the open-world game, while a subsequent press release from Rockstar Games revealed that the game will be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and Series S in 2025. However, there was no update on when or if the game would be coming to PC, much to the dismay of many PC gaming enthusiasts.</p>
